# Heads up!
- **There is a reference to [REDACTED] be aware of that.**
- **Sadly, there's not a WIKI yet.** :(
- **My brother was the one who gave me the idea for this mod.**
## Thank you for reading. Now let's talk about the real stuff.
### This mod adds:
- A new structure, which has a moderate chance to spawn.
- Armor to help you stay alive longer.
- A Katana and a Battle Axe.

~~I also have no care if you just dip this, I just want to show off my modding skills.~~ <- **This is a joke by the way. I really do care if you download this.** Oh and I have been working on this since **2019**. I'm only deciding to upload this now.
